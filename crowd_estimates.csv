JBEAP-4256,2,0.57,40,This will require a database change and integrated testing to be sure the SSO code works and is properly recorded. You can't do much in less than a week if there are multiple resources involved.,B
JBEAP-4256,2,0.57,80,"Depends if logging is already in place. It should be trivial to capture even simple print statements on authentication, the more interesting design issue is writing good log statements and getting it reviewed by others.",B
JBEAP-4256,3,0.52,40,"though the code should be fairly simple, integration & testing take time",B
JBEAP-4256,3,0.52,40,"I think it really just depends on the person that you have on the job, but giving it a week is probably justified. It depends on how long it takes to implement trace log code changes.",B
JBEAP-4256,3,0.52,40,"nswer:
The rationale or justification for doing any research must be gleaned from the existing literature on the subject. You will need to conduct a thorough literature survey and identify gaps in the current literature. The best way to write this is to introduce the current literature in the background/Introduction section and then highlight the gaps in the literature that have not been addressed or are yet to be understood. This will help set up the need for the current study and thus justify the need for this research",C
JBEAP-4256,3,0.52,40,The solution will require at least a week because there is missing information. Finding this info might be challenging and take some time the right info is needed and if not things will get complicated.,B
JBEAP-4256,3,0.52,4,I believe it is the necessary time,D
JBEAP-4256,3,0.52,8,The task is not inherently complex but might need additional infrastructure if reporting capabilities are not already available.,B

of RexDynamicParam and RexRangeRef to RexCopier",B
CALCITE-2738,1,0.48,40,The whole coding and testing completion would estimated a week work,B
CALCITE-2738,1,0.48,4,good one,D
CALCITE-2738,1,0.48,20,This is most likely similar to the implementation for other nodes should not take more than few days.,C
CALCITE-2738,1,0.48,8,Check the function compatibility issues. or version changes. Fix the issue and test issue,B
CALCITE-2738,1,0.48,-1,testing and debugging would take most of the time,B
CALCITE-2738,1,0.48,8,"Since you say that there is an implementation that is similar to the other RexNodes, I feel that it shouldn't take all too long",B
CALCITE-2738,1,0.48,20,The changing of singular nodes to affect the entire structure will take quite some time to properly recorrelate the entire network.,B
CALCITE-2738,1,0.48,40,"Copying of RexDynamicParam and RexRangeRef are not supported now. but I think, that the implementation is similar to other RexNodes. So its tricky. And it may take time.",B
CALCITE-2738,2,,40,"Testing and debugging will take a while, but also changing the implementation will take quite a while. All of that will easily take a few days",B
CALCITE-2738,2,,80,its like i can learn something and can enjoy experimenting it,D
CALCITE-2738,2,,8,Implement Rexnode code changes at client side scripting to have copy text or set of string functionality,B
CALCITE-2738,2,,40,for one person,D
CALCITE-2738,2,,40,"Tricky implementation from scratch, but since there's already a similar implementations available for use, I'd say it would take about one week.",B
CALCITE-2738,2,,20,The implementation may be similar but will require to be tested and verified with Unit Testig update,B
CALCITE-2738,2,0.67,8,Implementation is similar as already specified ...so just copy paste,D
CALCITE-2738,2,0.67,1,The issue is very easy where one hour is enough to do it,C
CALCITE-2738,2,0.67,8,"If the implementation is similar to other RexNodes, there must definitely be a work-around where RexDynamicParam and RexRangeRef can be added. The raw coding for each of those two can be stripped and added in. An experienced programmer should definitely be able to finish this within a day.",B
CALCITE-2738,2,0.67,20,"I think that if there already is a Rex node integration in the system, that finding out how to configure it is just as simple as reverse engineering, but I would give it over a day for some wiggle room.",B
CALCITE-2738,2,0.67,40,"Copying of RexDynamicParam and RexRangeRef are not supported now. but I think, that the implementation is similar to other RexNodes. So its tricky. And it may take time.",B
CALCITE-2738,2,0.67,1,The job seems easy but complications can always arise. The person thinks that is similar to other RedNodes but this can turn out to be wrong. Its a problem that can be over in a day but it can also take a long time if problens rise. It can take an hour or it can take half a week.,B
CALCITE-2738,2,0.67,20,"If there are similar implementations, it just a matter of research and finding the way around. with the proper documentation it shouldn't take more that a week",B
CALCITE-2738,3,0.67,20,The person is confident in his/her abilities but the solution to the problem might not be that easy. If the solution turns out to be more complicated than expected then solving the problem can take a couple of days.,B
CALCITE-2738,3,0.67,1,The issue has already been resolved.,B
CALCITE-2738,3,0.67,40,"I found code on github but not sure how much I trust it, would need to test",B

WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,1,I will have to learn how to do it and then complete the project which is time consuming,D
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,4,"Probably there is an error with the syntax or user configures. The programm displays already a common error message, thus the problem should solved fairly quickly",B
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,20,I think that this is an issue that though can be solved with someone who knows what they're doing pretty quickly it still can take alot of time and even more so depending on their pace and if they're making mistakes,C
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,4,"This must be a configuration change. Or environment change / security issue. 
Make the necessary changes and test with all environments ",B
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,4,as it should be reconfigured it should hardly take half a day to ease out the error,C
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,4,"I think that, without any other problem, a person should fix it in half a day because you need at least one hour to google it, find documentation, another hour to understood the key problem and at least two other hours to fix it and do some test",B
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,1,It would take some time to gather this information but with expertise it should take about half a day,C
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,8,"Seems like a simple enough issue to fix, would probably take a day at most, and that is more than enough time. Half a day might be underestimating, so a full day just to be safe that it is done up to standard.",B
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,20,good,D
WFCORE-2348,1,0.83,4,It might take a few hours or half a day to correct the scripts of the program. It might be a simple problem but it can also get complicated finding the mistake and finding an apt solution.,B
